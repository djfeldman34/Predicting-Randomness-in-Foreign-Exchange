# Predicting Randomness in Foreign Exchange
Our goal is to analyze data from the Foreign Exchange Market (Forex) and determine the parameters, such as market events,  that affect the value of a currency. If the leading indicators can be learned sufficiently, then one would be able to predict the state of a time evolving market given a set of initial conditions. The data will be sourced though resources such as Kaggle.com.

## Hypothesis
Forex has a natural pattern it will forever struggle to obtain, making one able to predict the ups and downs of the market, if outside contributing factors are identifiable.
## Null Hypothesis
Forex is unpredictable and has to many unknown factors that contribute uniquely to the market, each of whom’s impact are dependent on one, or many, other factors; making predicting the market’s ups and downs nearly impossible.
## Data Sources
<ul>
  <li>Forex data from Yahoo finance</li>
  <li>Forex data from Kaggle.com</li>
  <li>News articles from Kaggle.com</li>
  <li>Major events with dates from Kaggle.com</li>
 </ul>
 
## Data Structures
<ul>
  <li>Join data based on currency used in the area</li>
  <li>Join data based on date of event, with market data for that day</li>
  </ul>
  
## User Experience
<ul>
  <li>Users will be able to look at and evaluate the data themselves.</li>
<li>They will be able to look at different ranges of the days for a specific currency as well as events that occurred during the selected time range.</li>
  
  </ul>
  
# Conclusions

# Project Status
We are still working on a way to make the visualizations and data structures useful for actual market prediction.

As of now, we have visualizations of the groupings of trade types without an effect way to use them for future prediction.
