# Predicting Randomness in Foreign Exchange
Our goal is to analyze data from the Foreign Exchange Market (Forex) and determine the parameters, such as market events,  that affect the value of a currency. If the leading indicators can be learned sufficiently, then one would be able to predict the state of a time evolving market given a set of initial conditions. The data will be sourced though resources such as Kaggle.com.
